- This is the first version of the site in my project history. The very first one couldn't be fully recovered
- The documentation will not as be as detailed in this one, but it will be in the next one
- In the next one, I am using Nuxt
- That being said, the workflow for this project is very nice and intricate. I am using:
  - Gulp as my task runner
  - Sass for my CSS compiler
  - Netlify for my deploying agent
